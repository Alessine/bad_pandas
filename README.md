It all started with the book ['Effective Pandas'](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book) by [Matt Harrison](https://github.com/mattharrison). I got it some time ago to work on my skills with the Pandas library. Even though I have been using this library for a while in my job and also for personal projects, I had a hunch that my code could become more efficient and clean. Already in the first few chapters, I gained a lot of knowledge that I can directly apply in my work.

To maximize my learning, I like to type up the code, run it and take notes on my insights in a Jupyter Notebook whenever I study something related to coding. At one point I got the idea to turn this into a blog post, by comparing common mistakes that I used to make and learned to correct from this book. You can check out my progress here. Hopefully the publication will follow soon.
