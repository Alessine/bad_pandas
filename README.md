I got this book some time ago to work on my skills with the Pandas library. Even though I have been using this library for a while in my job and also for personal projects, I had a hunch that my code could become more efficient and clean. Already in the first few chapters, I gained a lot of knowledge that I can directly apply in my work.

To maximize my learning, I like to type up the code, run it and take notes on my insights in a Jupyter Notebook whenever I study something related to coding. Maybe these materials can be useful for someone else, so I'm sharing them here.
